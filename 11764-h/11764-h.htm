    <p>We believe that if we do the work to which God has called us, he will move the
    hearts of his children to provide the money. By as much as our work is successful, it
    is expansive. They are following closely in the steps of the Master who are teaching
    and ministering unto the needy and the poor. We are confident that they can safely
    trust in his word, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
    these things shall be added unto you." If God sends our workers out he will send
    supplies. There is no limit to the measure in which God can work on Christian hearts,
    to move his children to give for those who have gone forth to "seek the kingdom of
    God and his righteousness."</p>
    <p>While God is abundantly blessing our work in our great and wide fields among four
    races, we may safely ask our Christian friends to appeal to him that we shall have
    not only the needful funds to carry on the work without debt, but also enough to
    enable us to enter the doors which he opens. We are needing <i>eight thousand
    dollars</i> to keep our accounts balanced, and we ask those, in whose names we stand,
    to pray that all these things be added unto us. Has any pastor forgotten to take the
    collection?</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Rev. C.J. Ryder, recently assigned to the District Secretaryship of our Eastern
    District, with rooms at Boston, will be found at the office in the Congregational
    House, March 1st. He will be ready to respond to invitations from the churches to
    present our cause, and can speak from a large experience in our widely-extended and
    varied work. We commend Mr. Ryder to the churches.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>President Woodworth, of Tougaloo University, is in the North for a few weeks, and
    will represent the growing and very hopeful interests of Tougaloo, wherever he may be
    desired. Letters directed to our office in New York will be forwarded to him.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
    <p>Prof. Horace Bumstead, of Atlanta University, is now in the North to present the
    needs of that institution, and we trust that he will have large success. He will be
    happy to send the <i>Atlanta Bulletin</i> to those who may write for it, addressing
    him at 148 Tremont Street, Boston. In the light of the large convention of Negroes
    lately held at Macon, Ga., the <i>Bulletin</i> will be found exceedingly
    suggestive.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The Indian Presbytery of Dakota, composed of converted Sioux Indians, during the
    last ecclesiastical year gave $571 more to Foreign Missions than <i>any other
    presbytery in the synod</i>, and during the last synodical year gave to the nine
    Boards of that church $234 more than any of the white presbyteries of the synod.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Nannie Jones, a normal graduate at Fisk University, of the class of 1886, is to
    go, under the auspices of the American Board, to the south-eastern part of Africa,
    about 600 miles from Natal. She is the first single colored woman sent out by the
    American Board. She has been adopted by the Ladies' Board of the Interior, whose
    head-quarters are at Chicago.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>We thank our friends anew for the many kind words of sympathy, in view of our
    loss, and for their appreciative testimonies in memory of our departed associate,
    Rev. Dr. Powell.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The hearty commendations of the "AMERICAN MISSIONARY," with enclosures for renewed
    subscriptions, are also gratefully acknowledged.</p>

    <p>The death of Mr. Wm. L. Clark, who passed away in November last, has removed from
    the list of the early and efficient workers of the A.M.A. in the South, one who
    deserved the warmest regards for his fidelity, his excellent services and his
    self-sacrificing spirit. Mr. Clark began his work for the Association in 1868, as a
    teacher, in Bainbridge, Ga., and was subsequently at Thomasville and Atlanta. He was
    for a time afterwards editor and publisher of a paper devoted to the interests of the
    colored people and the South. His last years were spent in Washington, D.C.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a>
    <p>An intelligent negro, a graduate of one of our institutions, writes to us these
    words: "The A.M.A. is doing more to quicken the hopes and aspirations of the Southern
    Negro, and more toward arousing the Southern white man to just ideas of education,
    and more toward bringing the two races to an acknowledgment of each other's rights
    and duties, than all other institutions or influences in the country."</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
    <p>When the war closed there were 4,000,000 slaves set free in this country,
    absolutely poor, absolutely ignorant. The black race doubles itself in twenty years;
    and it is supposed that there are now about 8,000,000 Negro people. Of these,
    3,000,000 may have learned to read and write; there must be 5,000,000 still in
    illiterate and superstitious darkness. That they are still trying hard to learn, will
    be accentuated by the perusal of a specimen of letters to us from locations less
    favored than others:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Sir Deare Bretterin I will Rite you A few lines to let you no our condison, we

    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <p>The American Missionary Association, which is the authorized and recognized
    servant of the Congregational Churches, reporting to them from the fields to which it
    is sent in their name, not unfrequently meets the fact that schools and churches in
    the South are appealing for support to those who hold us responsible for mission work
    in the South. Thus many in the North from time to time, are contributing to schools
    or perhaps to churches there, under the impression that they are thus taking the
    shortest path to the work which appeals to them.</p>
    <p>There are many schools, of one kind and another, which have been started at the
    South by private parties on a purely independent basis. Many of these are carried on
    for a little time and then are permitted to die out for one reason and another; and
    many of them are working not only with a great lack of efficiency in comparison with
    the A.M.A. schools, but without supervision and without scrutiny. Some are located
    where it has pleased those who located them to reside, without much reference to
    relative necessities; and some are located so unwisely that the Association has been
    compelled to decline to take them, when through fatigue or failure they have been
    given up. Some of them owe their existence to the fact that certain workers were
    found to be not adapted to the work, or were uncomfortable under supervision and
    superintendence. Some of them are conducted by those who have signally failed in our
    schools. Their projectors are often skillful in letter-writing and in solicitation of
    funds for their specific enterprises, which being purely personal, have no large and
    ultimate achievement. Those who give cannot know <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> whether the donations are most wisely
    used, nor is there any satisfactory method by which contributions can be traced.</p>
    <p>The Association, with its Superintendent continually in the field, reporting every
    fact to the Secretaries at the office, who in turn report to the churches, is
    certainly much better prepared to direct the gifts of the benevolent in ways that
    shall not be unwise or irresponsible. As these circulars and letters of appeal are
    often referred by those who receive them to the Secretaries, it is but their duty to
    say that all funds diverted from our treasury to schools or churches in the South,
    under no watch and care, would without doubt go further and help the great work more
    to which the A.M.A. is consecrated, if they should be sent through the channel which
    the churches have ordained, and which has not only this justification for its
    existence and work, but also the justification of long experience and success.</p>
    <p>If the friends of the American Missionary Association, upon receiving appeals from
    colored pastors or people in the South, or from independent schools, would remember
    <i>that their own ordained agency</i> can open and supervise as many schools and
    churches as they will make possible with their contributions, no doubt less money
    would be diverted and far greater efficiency secured. Schools in the North without
    supervision or superintendence, are usually inferior. Much more are these
    irresponsible, unadvised and independent schools in the South.</p>

    <h4>SHALL CHRIST OR MOHAMMED WIN AFRICA?</h4>
    <p>Ultimately Christ will, as we know by the sure word of prophecy; immediately,
    Mohammed gains most rapidly, as present facts seem to indicate. The rapid strides of
    Mohammedanism in Africa have been noticed by nearly all recent explorers and
    travelers, but the full statement of the fact has been brought forth more vividly in
    a remarkable book written by a remarkable man. The book is entitled,
    "<i>Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race</i>." The author is Edward W. Blyden,
    LL.D., of whom it is said by a competent witness&mdash;and our own personal
    acquaintance with him confirms the testimony, so far as we are competent to
    judge&mdash;that he is a great traveler and an accomplished linguist, equally
    familiar with Hebrew and Arabic, with Greek and Latin, with five European and with
    several African languages, and, had he been born a European, might fill and adorn
    almost any public post. Dr. Blyden was born a full-blooded Negro in the Danish Island
    of St. Thomas, emigrated in his seventeenth year to Liberia, entered an American
    missionary school and rose to the head of it, became in 1862 Professor in the College
    of Liberia, and, two years later, Secretary of State in the African Republic. In
    1877, he represented Liberia at the Court of St. James, as Minister Plenipotentiary,
    and has been abundantly decorated with honorary degrees.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
    <p>Dr. Blyden's opportunities for knowing the facts are unquestioned, and his book
    presents in very striking array the advantages which in some respects Islam enjoys
    over Christianity in the propagation of its faith in Africa. The discussion has been
    continued by Canon Taylor of York, England, and, more recently, in a very clear
    article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, by Dean R. Bosworth Smith. Our space does
    not permit us either to summarize the facts as to this progress, nor can we present
    all the reasons for it. But one of these reasons touches so nearly a point that is of
    such vital interest to American Christians, that we feel called upon to state it and
    emphasize it. We abridge the full statement thus: Christianity has labored under the
    great disadvantage of coming to the Negro in "a foreign garb." Its teachers came from
    a land that first reached the Negro by capturing him as a slave; they came to him
    with the conscious or unconscious air of superiority born of race-prejudice.
    Christianity came to him as the creed, not of his friends, his well-wishers, his
    kindred, but of his masters and oppressors. They differed from him in education, in
    manners, in color, in civilization. Mohammedanism, on the other hand, reached the
    Negro in his own country, in the midst of his own surroundings. When it had
    acclimatized itself and taken root in the soil of Africa, it was handed on to others,
    and then no longer exclusively by Arab missionaries, but by men of the Negro's own
    race, his own proclivities, his own color. The advantages of this method of approach
    cannot be over-estimated. We care not to enter at all into the question of the value
    of the two religions nor of the good they may respectively do for poor Africa. We
    wish simply to deal with the methods and means, and with the peoples who may best
    employ them. We again summarize the language of Dean Smith: The very fact that there
    are millions of Negroes in America and the West India Islands, many of whom are men
    of cultivation and lead more or less Christian lives, is proof positive that
    Christianity is welcomed by them. Is there not room to hope that many of these men,
    returning to their own country, may be able to present Christianity to their
    fellow-countrymen in a shape in which it has never yet been presented,&mdash;in which
    it would be very difficult for Europeans or Americans ever to succeed in presenting
    it&mdash;to them, and may so develop a type of Christianity and civilization combined
    which shall be neither American nor European, but African, redolent alike of the
    people and of the soil?</p>
    <p>This is a point which the American Missionary Association has frequently urged,
    and which it had begun to exemplify by sending colored missionaries to Western
    Africa. The experiment was in many respects satisfactory, but we realized that a
    longer training and a more thorough maturing of character were needed in those who
    had just emerged from the darkness and limitations of slavery. But what greater hope
    can there be for Africa than in the training of these millions, so apt in learning,
    so <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> earnestly
    religious, and so well qualified to meet as brothers and friends their kindred in the
    Dark Continent! Here is a work for American Christians, full of promise of a glorious

    <h4>THE VERNACULAR IN INDIAN SCHOOLS.</h4>
    <p>After some considerable delay, Commissioner Atkins has issued revised Regulations
    in regard to the teaching of Indian languages in schools. That our readers may have
    them in distinct form we append them:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"1. No text books in the vernacular will be allowed in any school where children
      are placed under contract, or where the Government contributes, in any manner
      whatever, to the support of the school; no oral instruction in the vernacular will
      be allowed at such schools. The entire curriculum must be in the English
      language.</p>
      <p>"2. The vernacular may be used in missionary schools only for oral instruction
      in morals and religion, where it is deemed to be an auxiliary to the English
      language in conveying such instruction.</p>
      <p>"3. No person other than a native Indian teacher will be permitted to teach in
      any Indian vernacular, and these native teachers will only be allowed in schools
      not supported in whole or in part by the Government, at remote points, where there
      are no Government or contract schools where the English language is taught. These
      schools under native teachers only, are allowed to teach in the vernacular with a
      view of reaching those Indians who cannot have the advantages of instruction in
      English, and they must give way to the English-teaching schools as soon as they are
      established where the Indians can have access to them."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In response to a special application for authority to instruct a class of
    theological students in the vernacular, at the Santee School, the Commissioner
    says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"There is no objection to your educating a limited number of Indians in the
      vernacular, as missionaries, in some separate building, entirely apart from the
      Santee School. This instruction in the vernacular must be conducted entirely
      separate from the English course, and must not interfere with English studies or be
      considered part of the ordinary course for any other pupils of the school than the
      limited number agreed upon, not to exceed thirty, and all instruction in the
      vernacular must be conducted at no expense to the Government."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since writing the above, we have received from Commissioner Atkins a copy of rules
    designed to explain the orders quoted above. We are constrained to say that these
    explanations will probably not remove the objections that have been widely
    entertained against the rulings of the Department. It must be admitted, however, that
    there are difficulties in the way of formulating regulations that in their details
    shall meet the views of all parties concerned. On the one hand, there is the aim of
    Commissioner Atkins, in which we all coincide, to introduce the English language
    among the Indians as speedily as possible. On the other hand, there is the aim of the
    churches, in which we are glad to believe the Commissioner coincides, to spread the
    gospel as rapidly as possible among the Indians. The churches feel that it is a duty
    they owe to God and to those Indians who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
    id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> cannot understand English to teach them in the
    language in which they were born, and they believe, too, as the result of long
    experience, that Christian schools in the vernacular are among the most important
    means to that end, especially as pioneer movements. American Christians believe, too,
    that they have the right as American citizens to use their own methods&mdash;tested
    by experience&mdash;without the interference of the Government; and we believe they
    will feel constrained to protest in every legitimate and honorable way against such
    interference. We hope that the Department of the Interior will yet make the needful
    concessions.</p>

    <h3>THE SOUTH.</h3>
    <p>Rev. Dr. A.G. Haygood, the author of <i>Our Brother in Black</i>, and the general
    administrator of the John F. Slater fund, was in Macon a few days ago, visiting
    officially Lewis Normal Institute, which he pronounced an admirable school. The
    doctor made a thorough inspection of the school, and expressed himself as greatly
    pleased with its present management under Mrs. L.A. Shaw. He remarked that the
    improvement within the last two years is very noticeable in all departments, that the
    teaching is very thoroughly done and the industrial training systematically and
    efficiently carried on. Dr. Haygood preached, Sunday morning, at the Congregational
    Church to the edification of all who heard him.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The governor of Mississippi in his recent message commends our Institution at
    Tougaloo in the following generous terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The information derived from the President and Board of Visitors of <i>Tougaloo
      University</i> is of the most satisfactory character. During the year, additional
      school and industrial buildings have been erected, thus making all the appointments
      of the Institution excellent and commodious. The University is indebted to a
      generous-hearted gentleman of New York, Stephen Ballard, Esq., for the funds
      necessary for these buildings. The labor of erecting them was performed by the
      students under the direction of the Superintendent of Industries, thus economizing
      cost of labor, and at the same time demonstrating the valuable training of the
      students. The timely and generous donation of Mr. Ballard serves to carry on under
      the same roof, blacksmithing, wagon-making, painting, tinning and carpentry.</p>
      <p>"This University not only endeavors to encourage and conduct intelligently farm
      work of every description, but to teach and thoroughly instruct the boys in the
      several industries mentioned, as well as in the use of the steam-engine, saw, etc.
      The girls, in addition to the studies prescribed, are taught practical household
      duties in all their details. During the year <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
      id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> Rev. G.S. Pope, who has been President of the
      University for a decade, and who labored faithfully to advance its interests, was
      transferred to another field of labor. His place is filled by Frank G. Woodworth,
      who assumes the Presidency of the Institution and who will earnestly strive to
      advance its interests and sustain its already excellent reputation. This
      University, by its successful management, commends itself to your favorable
      consideration."</p>

    <a name="south2" id="south2"></a>
    <p>The most important gathering of negroes that probably has ever occurred, was in
    Macon, Ga., a few weeks since. Five hundred leading Negro representatives convened to
    discuss and adopt "a thorough plan of State organization." A permanent organization
    was effected and named the "<i>United Brotherhood of Georgia</i>," the purpose of
    which is "to resist oppression, wrong and injustice." We note the following
    resolutions, which were passed by the convention:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That we, in convention assembled, respectfully but earnestly
      demand of the powers that be, that the Negro be given what, and only what, he is
      entitled to.</p>
      <p><i>Resolved further</i>, That never, until we are in the fullest enjoyment of
      our rights at the ballot-box, will we cease to agitate and work for what justly
      belongs to us in the shape of suffrage.</p>
      <p><i>Further resolved</i>, That it shall be the policy of the colored race to vote
      so as to bring the greatest division to the white voters of this country, for in
      this we believe lies the boon of our desire.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The last resolution is not entirely plain to us, and we refrain from comment upon
    it, but the convention itself, the fact of leadership taking shape among the Negroes,
    and the forth-putting of their purposes, are very significant.</p>
    <p>When the Glenn Bill was born, and when the Georgia House of Representatives stood
    sponsor for its baptism, we believed that the enemy of righteousness had made a
    mistake, and that this particular piece of artillery would kick. They who think to
    thwart the providences of God usually help them forward. Christianity has had many a
    help from its opposers.</p>
    <p>Upon the incidental question of temperance, the sentiments of the convention were
    voiced by one of the speakers in these words: "The best thing for the Negro is
    industry, temperance, virtue, economy, union and courage. Get land, get money, get
    education; be sober and be virtuous. We have drunk enough whiskey since the war to
    build a railroad from Atlanta to Savannah. The Negro race cannot be great except as
    individuals rise towards greatness." They are rising. A little more yeast, good
    friends.</p>

    <h4>THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE A.M.A.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY REV. FORREST F. EMERSON.</p>
    <p>The report of the Executive Committee on educational work in the South, confirms
    the conviction which must have impressed itself on many minds, that the Association
    is a divinely-appointed agency for carrying forward a work delegated to us as a
    <i>nation</i>. God calls nations as he calls men, and consecrates them to a special
    work. Rome had a call, and fulfilled it, under the Divine Providence, and that call
    was to work out the idea, and demonstrate the necessity, of government, and to
    cultivate in the minds of men everywhere regard for the authority of law; Greece had
    her mission, and it was to teach the value of individual culture, both physical and
    intellectual; the people of Israel had their call to teach the doctrine of God, of
    his moral government, and of the eternal nature of moral law; <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> and this Christian
    nation has its divine call, and that call arises from the peculiar relation which it
    sustains to the other races and nations of the earth.</p>
    <p>For a long time it seemed as if this land was to be given exclusively to the
    English race. The Dutch who settled here were assimilated and absorbed; the Spaniards
    and Portuguese found a congenial clime in South America; the French, by the progress
    of events, were prevented from gaining a foothold in New England, and with the sale
    of so-called "Louisiana"&mdash;an immense area extending from the Gulf to British
    America,&mdash;France relinquished her last claim to ownership of any part of our
    domain. The period of history, from the landing at Jamestown and Plymouth to the war
    of 1812, and later, was the unfolding of events which pointed to the supremacy of the
    English in North America. Our religion was Protestant and English; our literature
    took root in English forms of thought; our free institutions were the outcome of
    principles which had been, and now are, influential in English politics; our common
    law was English, our traditions of liberty were English, and that union of liberty
    and law which makes us strong, we inherited from our English fathers. So that in
    1820, two hundred years after the arrival of the Mayflower, we were essentially an
    English nation; old England broken away from old forms and precedents, the natural
    expansion of England under new forms of government and society.</p>
    <p>Now it would have been pleasant, to human ways of thinking, if we could have
    remained always thus homogeneous. But God had a work for us to do. We were not left
    to sit down amidst the vast resources which the land affords for material prosperity,
    and just watch and foster our own growing and expanding life, but God gave us four
    problems to solve. These four problems came to us from the four quarters of the
    globe, the Indian of America on the North, the Chinaman of Asia on the West, the
    descendant of Africa on the South, and the emigrant of Europe on the East, who
    poured, in great masses, through our Eastern gates, the German unbeliever, the Irish
    Catholic, the Mormon convert, and representatives of every race of Europe.</p>
    <p>The English race, which still represents the heart and brain of the nation,
    confronts these four problems. The problem on the North and South we brought on
    ourselves, as results on the one hand of our neglect and injustice, and on the other
    of our cupidity and cruelty. The troubles that come to us through our Eastern and
    Western ports, are drawn to us by the attractive influence of our free institutions
    and our material prosperity.</p>
    <p>What are we to do with these alien elements? Do as Rome did. When Rome heard of a
    hostile nation on her borders, she conquered it, attached it to the Empire, and made
    it a new pillar of imperial power. So are we to conquer every element of darkness and
    attach it to the kingdom of light, making it an element of strength in our American
    civilization and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg
    67]</span> our American Christianity. The difference in the method is the difference
    between paganism and Christianity, for while Rome conquered with a sword of steel, we
    conquer with the sword of the Spirit. We conquer by giving gifts unto men, the four
    gifts of law, land, letters and religion. We have given law to the African and the
    European with citizenship and the ballot; we have given land to the African and the
    European, and, thanks to Christian statesmanship, we will soon give it to the Indian
    in severalty; and to all will we give letters and religion.</p>
    <p>It is the peculiar glory of this Association that it deals more directly than any
    other agency with the gravest and most urgent of these problems, the education of the
    colored race, so that while the Government gives the Negro citizenship, and permits
    him to own land, this society undertakes the work of fitting him for the ownership of
    land and for the responsibility of citizenship. And it is doing this in the genuine
    way, through the gospel of Christ, and education as the handmaid and helper of the
    gospel&mdash;that helper without which Christianity would be falsely conceived, and
    erroneously applied, and without which a failure would result in the ethical training
    of the colored race. The Association, by its educational work, is thus fulfilling the
    divine purpose in the call made to us as a Christian nation.</p>
    <p>The report of the committee also suggests the heroic element in our work. It
    brings to mind the obstacles and difficulties which we are called upon to overcome.
    The illiteracy of the colored people is a fact immense in extent and dark in its
    prophetic significance. Your hearts were rejoiced, I know, by the statements of the
    changes going on in the education of the colored children in several States through
    free schools. The need of this movement will be appreciated when we remember the
    figures which bring before us the present illiterate condition of the people. I
    present the outline of a report made in January, 1885, based on reports of Albion
    Tourgee, and on articles in the <i>North American Review</i>. According to that
    report, seventy-three per cent. of the colored population of the South cannot read
    and write. In the eight Gulf and Atlantic States, seventy-eight per cent. are in the
    same condition. Over two millions of colored people in these eight States cannot read
    and write. But this is not all. We must take into account the rapid increase of the
    negroes. In three States of the South they already outnumber the whites. In eight
    States, they are about one-half the population. In all the Southern States they
    increase faster than the white population. From 1870 to 1880, in the eight States
    mentioned above, they increased thirty-four per cent., the whites only twenty-seven
    per cent. The immigration of foreign-born whites will not change the proportionate
    difference of increase, as the foreign-born white population has decreased 30,000
    since the war, and the immigration of northern-born whites amounts to only a fraction
    of one per cent. According to the present <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
    id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> rate of increase, the colored race in one hundred
    years from now will have a population many millions in excess of the whites, since,
    while it will take thirty-five years for the white race to double its numbers, the
    blacks will do so every twenty years. In less than twenty-five years from this date,
    the colored race in the South will outnumber the whites in nearly all the States, and
    then the world will witness a conflict of races, the aspiration of the negro against
    the caste-prejudice of the white, the end and result of which no man can foresee.</p>
    <p>These facts all point to the greatness of the work undertaken by this Association.
    Christian education is the only education for a race having before it such a future.
    The illiteracy which we deplore must be overcome, but something more than that; that
    change must be provided for, when the Negro in large numbers will pass from the quiet
    and peaceful pursuits of agriculture to be massed together in mine and factory and
    the work of the mechanic arts, but something more than that; intelligence for the
    burden of citizenship must be given, but something more than that; incentives to the
    accumulation of property and the building of homes for themselves and their families
    must be encouraged, but something more than that must be done. If we were simply
    patriots, we would educate these people; if we were only philanthropists, or wise
    statesmen, or political economists, we would still feel bound to educate them. But we
    are more than these, we are Christians, and so there is one other thing we must do
    besides these I have mentioned, something which includes all these and so is greater
    than they all&mdash;and that thing is to make them Christian. Education is a part of
    the means to be used, and not the total end and aim.</p>
    <p>For what is education? Not the mere accumulation of knowledge, nor the mere
    training of the powers of the mind, but the building of manhood. You have tempered
    your Damascus blade, but who is going to hold it&mdash;the patriot, or the rebel? You
    have your educated man with his printing press, but what is he going to
    print&mdash;the Police Gazette or the Gospel of St. John? You have built your college
    and found your young man, and trained him up to the very highest point of mental
    excellence and power, but what is he going to do with his mind? The mind is only an
    instrument under the direction of the man. The great thing is the ethical man who is
    going to use this mind. If there is any thing the American people need to learn, it
    is that there is one thing greater than talent, and that is character&mdash;the love
    and regard for righteousness.</p>
    <p>It is here that this Association does its work in the genuine way, regarding
    education as necessary for the colored race and for all races, not as an end in
    itself, but as an instrument in the hands of a man ethically and Christianly trained.
    The gospel must go with the school, so that we may train not only the hand and the
    brain, but also the conscience and the heart. When I think of the future of the Negro
    race in America, of the possibilities of that race already being revealed, of the
    immense political <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg
    69]</span> significance of its position to-day, of the certain increase of its
    numbers, of the inevitable collision of races by and by, unless there be a change in
    the spirit of the whites, I feel that no education is to be trusted but Christian
    education, an education based on the gospel of Christ.</p>
    <p>And to what purpose can any of us, with better hope of success, devote our time,
    our money, our labor? Let us have more money for this work. I would say no word to
    depreciate foreign missions, but is not this after all the work of foreign missions?
    How will you influence the future of China, or of Japan, or of Africa, or of Europe,
    in more direct, sympathetic, permanent ways, than by giving the gospel, and the
    education that goes with the gospel, to those at our very doors from all these lands,
    who shall carry back, and send back, to their own native countries the same gospel
    they have learned in this?</p>

    <p>I have never seen a worse day in the Territory than to-day. The snow was about two
    feet deep and light. Last night the wind began to blow, and to-day it is blowing a
    gale and the snow flies like powdered glass. Neither man nor beast can endure it. I
    cannot see my stable, which is within a stone's-throw of the house. I have wood and
    water enough in the house to last two or three days; so I shall not suffer
    personally, and I will spend the time of imprisonment in writing, if I can, between
    making fires. The snow sifts through my door and window until I have a regular
    snowbank all along the inside of the house. Though I am warm right by the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> stove, yet I cannot
    get the room warm enough to melt the snow. Last winter and this are the hardest I
    have ever seen in the Territory.</p>
    <p>So dear Dr. Powell has gone home! No one should feel sorry for him. How grand and
    glorious thus to be called home to God! I do not think the work here will suffer
    because he has gone from our sight. He is only promoted. God will no doubt let him
    work on in heaven; only gone from the ills that the flesh is heir to. Dead? Oh no! he
    is not dead. He is living evermore. May we all be as ready as was he for the final
    call!</p>
    <p>On the same day that he died, we trust that there passed through the gates with
    him one of our Indian boys, whose cause Dr. Powell had so eloquently pleaded. Harry
    Little-Eagle died like a hero. No one ever suffered more for four months than he, and
    not once did his faith fail. He prayed and sang, and talked for Jesus as long as his
    strength held out. The night before he died his voice returned, and he said: "God
    gave it back to me and told me to talk to the people." He did. He said: "I am going
    home, God will give me a greater work there to do. Do not cry. You must keep a stout
    heart and give my message to all the people." Then he prayed, "O Father, keep a big
    work for me. I have not lived here long. I have only known thee a short time, and I
    have been a great sufferer. I have done nothing for thee. Keep some work up there for
    me. I want to help you." Then he said: "Tell Winona to be brave; tell her to have a
    strong will; tell her to seek out the lost; some will believe and be saved. Tell her
    to continue to work for the people." I asked, "Are you afraid now, when you are so
    near the water?" "No," he replied, "I am in a hurry to go home." To his father he
    said: "God will send you a comforter. I will help prepare a home for you, and my
    mother and sister and brother. I shall wait for you."</p>
    <p>His father, Little-Eagle, seems inspired. New Year's Day he stood up before some
    Teton Indians and said: "I am one of you. You all know me. You all see me. You see
    the same body that has been on the war-path with you many times; the same body that
    has been rigged out in paint and feathers and rattlers, and has danced with you in
    the dance. The body is the same, but that is all. The part of me that your eyes
    cannot see is not the same. I am not the same. I think differently; I feel
    differently; I plan differently. I like different things; I am a new man. My heart is
    made clean in Christ. When I first tried to follow Christ, I was satisfied. I tried
    to do right and I thought God would own me. When my boy died he said: 'Tell the
    people that God has said, "Thou shalt have no God but me. Thou shalt not kill. Thou
    shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Remember the Sabbath to keep it
    holy."' Then my heart was heavy. All day and night I sat mute. I said: 'I have done
    all these things and my boy never did any of them. He will be saved and I shall be
    lost.' I went to Winona and told her. She told me: 'My friend, if we never had
    sinned, Christ would not have died. Because <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
    id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> you sinned and broke God's laws, Christ died for you.
    His death makes you his.' Then light came. Yes, I am a sinner, just like the rest of
    you. We have all done the same things. Now I stand here acquitted. Come to Christ.
    Come to God. You seek after food for the body; that is all your thought. I sought
    God, and when I sowed my seed in the spring, I prayed to God and attended to my soul,
    and God has taken care of my body. I wished, and he made my field flourish when all
    yours dried up in the sun. If you will seek God he will take care of your bodies.
    Trust in the Lord. Put away heathen dances and plays. Be not like children; be men
    and women and God will feed you."</p>
    <p>These were his words. He spoke the truth, for he is the only Indian who had an
    abundant crop.</p>
    <p>Little Eagle cannot speak an English word. His son Harry who died could read
    English a little. He learned at Santee. But his knowledge of the Bible, and his
    Bible-reading to the people and his work for Christ, were in his own tongue. It was
    the truth in his own tongue that saved Little Eagle. <i>Shall we not, then, teach the
    children Christian truths in their own language?</i></p>

    <h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>
    <h4>A CHINESE CHRISTIAN IN CHINA.</h4>
    <p>Chin Toy was a shoemaker until he accepted my invitation to become a Missionary
    Helper. His education, in English and as a Christian, has been wholly in our humble
    mission work. He is now engaged in evangelistic service. Having recently returned
    from a visit to his native land, I asked him to give me an account of his experience
    there. I give it below to the readers of the <i>Missionary</i>. W.C. POND.</p>
    <p>DEAR PASTOR:&mdash;You asked me kindly to give you my experience during my visit
    in China. I stayed home about ten months. I had a very hard time there at first,
    because I have no Christian friends who live near enough to help me. The temptations
    around me very great. My father and my uncle wanted me to help in their store: they
    had sacrifice-paper and candles for the offering of idols for sale. This hurted my
    feeling very much. I told them I was a Christian. I could not help in that business,
    for I know it was against the law of the true God. They laughed at me and said I was
    very foolish to believe such a doctrine. I found it very difficult to enlighten their
    minds.</p>
    <p>Two weeks after I got home was a birthday of my grandfather, who died many years
    ago. My father set some sacrifices on the parlor table, before the ancestral tablet;
    he wanted me to bow down and worship with him, but I refused. I told him while I
    honored my grandfather a great deal, yet I could not worship him. The Christians only
    worship the one true God. This made him very angry at me, he so angry that he did not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> take his
    breakfast that morning. From this time on, my father was cross to me very often, he
    called me a man without conscience. I did not mind about that, for I knew he loved me
    in his heart. He had not learned what Christianity was. I tried to please him all I
    could. When he scolded me I answered him softly. I prayed for him and for all my
    relatives every day. I asked the Lord to send the Holy Spirit to them, that they
    might prove what was good. Two or three months afterward, I found my father and
    relatives changed a great deal. They seemed to like Christianity more than they
    did.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I showed them some things which they never saw before, such as
    photograph album, Holy Bible, book of mission stories with many pictures in it. I
    explained the pictures to them and they were all pleased. I also told them that these
    good books were presented by my kind teachers. I gave the names of these faithful
    workers of the Lord and said they were the best friends of the Chinese, the reason
    was that they love Jesus. I then went on and told them about the true God, and his
    blessed Son Jesus, who love the whole world. They all kept quiet and listen
    attentively. Besides these, I show them my coal-oil stove, alarm clock, thermometer,
    etc. These things greatly pleased them. I told them the wonderful arts, the
    machineries, railways and the telegraphs. These news led them spoke out in a loud
    voice, "The people in Christian land have more wisdom than our Chinese." I said, "God
    gave this wisdom, our Chinese must love the true God and forsake the idols, then God
    will send the Holy Spirit to make us wise and happy, and love to do good. The Bible
    says, Trust the Lord and do good." After this, I found opportunity to preach the
    gospel every day. Though I could not make them become Christians yet, I was glad they
    shew so much interest in receiving the good seeds. Nearly every day, some people came
    in our little store and asked me to tell them about this new doctrine. During March,
    Rev. C.R. Hager paid us a visit. Our store was crowded with people. They all came to
    see him. He preached to them. Several of the students had a long talk with him.</p>
    <p>On the day of my marriage, my father did not compel me to worship the idols and
    ancestors. I felt very thankful for the Lord's help in this matter. My mother used to
    believe in all kinds of superstitions. If any one in the family was sick, she would
    go to a sorcerer and ask for some charms to heal the sick one. I told her that this
    kind of belief and doing were all wrong. I shew her how to pray the true God, and
    taught her to say the Lord's prayer. One day my sister was sick in bed, and my mother
    called me home to pray for her. I asked my mother whether she had been to the
    sorcerer or not. She said she had not. I then opened the Bible and read the first
    eleven verses from the fourth chapter of Matthew. I knelt and prayed, while my mother
    and all the rest of the family kept silent. When I said the Lord's prayer at the
    close, I asked them to follow <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
    id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> me, but they were too bashful to comply. I am glad to
    say that my sister's health was restored, and this greatly pleased my mother.</p>
    <p>During the month of March, the Chinese worship their ancestors at their respective
    graves. This kind of worship has two meanings, one is to repair and decorate the
    graves, the other, to worship with sacrifice, consisting of already cooked chicken
    and pork, and paper which represents money and clothing. My father and relatives, of
    course, follow the same custom. I accompanied them to the graves, but I only helped
    them in repairing the graves. Some of these relatives were school teachers. They
    spoke scornfully at me for not worshiping. They said, "You cannot show honor to your
    ancestors without kneeling before them." I then said to them, "Can you tell me the
    origin of sacrifice? Who established it, and for what purpose?" This seemed to strike
    them like lightning, for they all stood and had nothing to say. I then said, let me
    give you the origin. I told them that after God created heaven and earth and all
    things, he finally made a man and a woman, and placed them in Eden, the paradise, and
    how they sinned against God's command by eating the forbidden fruit. This brought
    death into the world. They were driven out of Paradise and had to work hard for a
    livelihood, but God was so merciful that he promised that the seed of the woman shall
    bruise the head of the serpent; that is, he would provide a Saviour, by which death
    could be conquered. God told them that when they sinned again, they must offer
    sacrifice and confess their sins, then God would forgive them. From that time on, the
    people offer sacrifice. This sacrifice is a type of Jesus, who gave his life and died
    on the cross for all who are willing to believe in him. So Jesus paid it all, and
    after his crucifixion there is no more offering required. That is the reason why the
    Christians do not offer sacrifice, and why I do not worship in this manner. For no
    one deserves our worship but God alone. I only honor the ancestors with my heart. I
    love them just as much as you do yourselves.</p>
    <p>When they heard this explanation, they were greatly surprised. Then they spoke
    among themselves by saying, "His doctrine is good; this is all news to us; our
    Confucius books never tell us about the origin of sacrifice." This seemed to break
    down their pride a great deal, and after this they shew great willingness to listen
    to the Word of Life. Oh! how I long to have them learn of Jesus and become His
    followers. I not only pray for them, but every one in our village. May the Lord bless
    the seed sown in their hearts. Moreover, may He enlighten every soul in China. Yours
    in Christ, CHIN TOY.</p>

    <p>Not many weeks since, the Congregational Sunday-school of Ithaca, N.Y., sent us
    forty-five dollars towards the education of an Indian girl at Santee Agency, saying
    "we expect to make it seventy dollars." The story "How I Became A Golden Missionary,"
    tells how they did it. It is a clear case of evolution. If any of our young people do
    not know what evolution is, they can learn how to start one by reading</p>
    <h4>HOW I BECAME A GOLDEN MISSIONARY.</h4>
    <p>My birthplace was in a very Superior region, as for millions of years I had dwelt
    near Lake Superior. My superior quality almost defied the arts of man. I first became
    conscious of existence when being liberated from my copper prison. I was, as I heard
    men say, ninety per cent. pure copper. Up to this time I had never been disturbed,
    but now sounded sharply the click of the hammer upon the cold chisel that rudely
    separated me from all that had been most closely associated with me. I heard men say
    that I was to be made over; and I was transported far away to a place where I was
    exposed to fierce fires, and without suffering I was made to assume a liquid form. I
    was then poured into a mold from which I came out, verily, a new creature. I was very
    bright and beautiful, shining and glowing, as if still retaining in myself the fires
    that had transformed me. I now discovered that I had a new name, for they called me
    "One Cent," and gave me this motto, "In God we trust."</p>
    <p>I heard it said that I was a tool to assist in civilization, and I soon found
    myself aiding men in commercial transactions. I had manifold experiences and, like
    most useful people, found that while age increased my usefulness it subdued my
    glitter. At last, after many, many years, I fell into the hands of a Sabbath-school
    Superintendent with a missionary spirit, and by him was distributed with many of my
    companions to the children of his Sabbath-school, with the injunction to multiply. I
    fell <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> into the
    hands of a boy who undertook to help me in a business way which should tend to my
    rapid increase. At the end of a fixed period I and my companions were to be returned
    to the Superintendent with our respective gains; and then, after relating our
    experiences, we were to be sent forth as missionaries to the Indians. Before this, my
    aims had been simply to aid in commerce, with no definite plan before me, and like
    all who have no fixed purpose, I drifted here and there and took no special interest
    in the world. But now I was to become a missionary; I was not only to aid in
    civilization but in advancing Christianity.</p>
    <p>My new aim in life made me anxious concerning the boy who was to be my helper. I
    took the deepest interest in all his plans in regard to me and listened attentively
    when he bargained with his father for a fourth of a cent's worth of yarn and the use
    of a needle with which to darn his father's socks. I thought that a boy of sixteen
    who was willing to increase me by undertaking to darn his father's stockings,
    deserved all the aid that I could give him. I looked on with interest and admiration,
    while he, with earnest toil, completed his task. When the task was ended, I found
    myself increased from one to three cents. This small beginning was in reality the
    most important of all our transactions and demonstrated that we could work
    harmoniously together.</p>
    <p>While he went to the St. Lawrence for his vacation, he did not give me a vacation
    nor wrap me in a napkin, but left me where I grew to four cents. Then we invested my
    whole increase in hickory nuts, which transaction increased me to fifteen cents. I
    here discovered that I had not only multiplied but had become of a more precious
    metal. I was now silver. We now invested in peanuts and hickory nuts and I was
    increased from fifteen to thirty cents. The community in which we lived manifested
    such a fondness for peanuts that we again invested and I found myself increased to
    seventy-five cents.</p>
    <p>Coming in contact with one who mourned over sleepless nights, we undertook to add
    to her comfort by making a hop pillow. Having invested in materials, and the boy
    making the pillow himself upon the machine, we realized an increase of twenty-five
    cents. Now to my great surprise and still greater delight, I found that I had again
    been transformed into a more precious metal. I was now gold. As I could attain no
    higher degree in precious metals, it was decreed that in this form I should go forth
    on my career as a missionary.</p>
    <p>Good-bye to you, Lottie, and Rose, and Marion, and John, and Carl, and Waldo. Our
    association has been very pleasant together, and I hope that in taking leave of you I
    am not to pass altogether from your knowledge. I should desire that this history of
    my growth and increase may accompany me, that in time to come I may be able to report
    to you of the good that through me you have been able to accomplish. Once more
    good-bye.</p>

    <h3>CHILDREN'S PAGE.</h3>
    <h4>THE STORY OF THE BULLETS.</h4>
    <p>Among some unpublished papers of the late Rev. Dr. Pike, we find the following
    story, which we know will be of interest to our readers, both from the sketch itself
    and the association with its author:</p>
    <p>A few years after Gen. Hooker fought his famous battle of the clouds, I visited
    Lookout Mountain, and, while searching for some memento on the battle-field, picked
    up a slightly bruised rifle bullet. This to me was a real prize. It was not too
    large, it would keep.</p>
    <p>A slight illness, aggravated by the fatigue of the day, induced me to accept the
    urgent request of a former acquaintance to spend the night with him upon the
    mountain. During the evening, I chanced to show him the bullet, saying I thought
    myself quite fortunate in finding it.</p>
    <p>"Oh," said he, "that's nothing. A colored woman after the battle gathered and sold
    so many that she was able to purchase a cow with the money, and now that cow supports
    her family."</p>
    <p>I left Chattanooga the nest morning, and thought no more of the incident for a
    dozen years. A short time since, however, I was spending the night in a small village
    in one of the mountain towns of Tennessee. At nightfall, looking out from my hotel, I
    observed a company of colored people ambling along towards a low wooden
    meeting-house, and time hanging heavily on my hands, I decided to join the dusky
    worshipers. I slipped in, therefore, when the meeting was a little under way, and
    allowed myself to be ushered up to the front seat, directly under the eye of an
    intelligent looking young man who proved to be the preacher for the occasion. After a
    few opening services, which embraced the usual variety in ordinary churches, the
    minister took for his text the passage, "Ask, and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall
    find, knock and it shall be opened unto you."</p>
    <p>"Now," said he, when he had gotten on well with his introduction, "you must not
    believe you will surely receive precisely the thing you ask for in just the way you
    might like it. Let me give you an illustration from my personal experience. When a
    little boy, I lived with my mother on the southern slope of Lookout Mountain, and
    remember well the day that Gen. Hooker fought his great battle up there and how he
    and his soldiers marched bravely away. For a long time the children and the grown
    people searched the battle-fields over, day after day, hoping to find things of
    value. My mother made it her business to hunt for bullets, and at length the number
    she gathered herself and took from us boys was so great that she was able to purchase
    a cow with the money they brought.</p>
    <p>"A benevolent gentleman living in New York at this time soon after secured the
    Government buildings on the top of the mountain that had <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> been used for the sick soldiers, and
    fitted them up nicely for Northern teachers, who opened a boarding-school for white
    students. I took milk to the institution from our cow, every morning, and how I
    wished that I might gain admittance to the school and procure an education! One day I
    heard the scholars reciting in concert, 'Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall
    find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.' It came over me most powerfully and I
    repeated it again and again. I said it to my mother, and inquired of her what it
    meant, and why it impressed me so, and who it was that said it.</p>
    <p>"She replied, 'I dunno. I reckon I'se heard dem words afore. 'Pears like dey was
    spoke by the bressed Lord.'</p>
    <p>"The more I thought of it, the more undecided I was what I could do, or what my
    mother could do for me, I knew, however, that the Lord could do everything.</p>
    <p>"Well, the nest time I met the good-natured teacher who managed the school, I made
    bold to ask him to allow me to tell him all about it, and this was his reply. 'Our
    Lord made that promise long before the discovery of America and the establishment of
    the peculiar institutions of this country. If he had lived at this day, I reckon,' he
    continued with a look of drollery, 'he would have said "Ask and ye shall
    receive&mdash;if you aint a nigger." I can't take you into my school because you are
    black, but I'll send you down to the American Missionary school at Chattanooga. You
    can ask and receive there whether you are black or white.'</p>
    <p>"So, shortly after he told my experience to the teacher in the town, who arranged
    that my mother should take me and the cow to a little farm just out of the city,
    giving me an opportunity to attend his school regularly until I was fitted to enter
    an institution of a higher grade. I then went away and pursued a course of study for
    six years, teaching during the summer and receiving aid from my mother, who kept the
    cow all the while for her own support and my assistance. I asked, I received, but not
    just in the way I hoped."</p>
    <p>When he had finished speaking, I took him heartily by the hand, told him of my
    early visit to the mountain and the bullet still in my possession. I talked with him
    about his teachers, his struggles for self-help, his aim to work for the progress of
    the church and his consecration to the duties of the Christian ministry. I conversed
    with him in reference to others of his acquaintance and believe that his experience
    serves to illustrate the ingenuity of the colored people in seeking their own
    advancement.</p>

    <p>The best MIXED PAINTS manufactured. Guaranteed to give perfect satisfaction if
    properly applied. They are <i>heavy bodied</i>, and for work that does not require an
    extra heavy coat, they can be thinned (with our Old Fashioned Kettle-boiled Linseed
    Oil) and still cover better than most of the mixed paints sold in the market, many of
    which have so little stock in them that they will not give a good solid coat.</p>
    <p>Some manufacturers of mixed paints direct NOT to rub out the paint, but to FLOW it
    on; the reason being that if such stuff were rubbed out there would be but little
    left to cover, would be transparent. Our Cottage Colors have great strength or body,
    and, like any good paint, should be worked out well under the brush. The covering
    property of this paint is so excellent as to allow this to be done.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
